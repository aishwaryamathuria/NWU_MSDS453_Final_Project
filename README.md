### MSDS453: Natural Language Processing
## Audio Enabled RAG-Enhanced Question Answering System with Knowledge Graph Integration

The goal of this project is to build an intelligent question-answering system for the **Sherlock Holmes stories** and extend it to **medical dataset** using speech-to-text (STT) for user queries and text-to-speech (TTS) for responses. The system combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with knowledge graph reasoning through the smolagents framework to build an agent capable of handling both retrieval and reasoning while interacting via speech.

The agent will process information from multiple Sherlock Holmes stories and extend to medical database, aiming to answer both simple and multi-step questions accurately. I chose this topic because it brings together two exciting areas in Natural Language Processing: foundational language models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced with knowledge graphs, and applies them to achieve a creative goal.
